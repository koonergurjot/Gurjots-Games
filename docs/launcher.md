# Gurjot Launcher Guide

## Overview
The Gurjot Launcher packages the desktop experience into a lightweight shell that keeps your local library, save data, and overlay tools in sync. This guide explains what ships with the launcher and how to keep it up to date once installed.

## Key capabilities
- One-click access to your installed games and recent sessions.
- Automatic update channel that mirrors the production catalog.
- Optional overlays for screenshots, timers, and performance metrics.

## Installation
1. Download the latest launcher build from the releases page or internal build share.
2. Run the installer and follow the prompts to choose an install directory.
3. Launch the appâ€”your existing Gurjot profile is detected automatically.

## Troubleshooting
If the launcher fails to start, clear the cache from the settings menu and retry. Persistent failures usually resolve after reinstalling with administrator rights. Reach out to the platform team if the installer reports missing dependencies.
