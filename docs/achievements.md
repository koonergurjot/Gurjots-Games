# Achievement Tracker

## Overview
The achievement tracker keeps a unified record of player milestones across the Gurjot catalog. Each game contributes badges, quest completions, and streaks so players can see progress in one place.

## Categories
Achievements are grouped into three buckets:
- **Core progression:** Story beats, skill unlocks, and completion of main questlines.
- **Skill challenges:** Speedrun targets, high-score thresholds, and flawless clears.
- **Community moments:** Co-op victories, seasonal event participation, and featured creator runs.

## Viewing progress
The in-shell tracker updates in real time as long as the player is online. Offline sessions sync the next time the launcher connects. For granular data, visit the stats dashboard or export the tracker JSON via the settings menu.

## Reporting issues
If an achievement fails to unlock, capture the session timestamp and submit it through the support channel. Include your profile ID and the specific goal so the team can investigate quickly.
