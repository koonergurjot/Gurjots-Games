# Beginner Tutorials

## Quick start path
New to Gurjot's Games? Start by cloning the repository, running `npm install`, and launching `npm run dev` to explore the shell locally. The [Overview](./OVERVIEW.md) document explains how the interface stitches together.

## Build your first game tile
1. Duplicate an existing entry inside `games/` and give it a unique slug.
2. Update `games.json` with title, description, and tags for your experience.
3. Run `npm run sync:games` to regenerate offline data before testing the play view.
