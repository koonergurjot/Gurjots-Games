# Submit a Game

## Requirements
Before submitting, confirm that your game runs in modern browsers, includes accessible controls, and exposes pause/reset options. Provide high-resolution cover art (1920x1080) and at least three in-game screenshots.

## Submission checklist
- Complete metadata in `games.json` including tags, difficulty, and release date.
- Upload the playable build under `games/<slug>` with a self-contained `index.html` entry point.
- Run `npm run health` locally to verify diagnostics pass.
- Include patch notes or a changelog for reviewers.

## Review timeline
The platform team reviews new submissions within seven days. Feedback or required fixes are tracked through GitHub issues. Once approved, the game is scheduled for the next catalog publish window.
